# Website navigation stub

This is a stub repo to investigate possible **cross-silo** navigation patterns based off the [EMBL Design Language Information Architecture](https://embl-design-language.github.io/Springboard/information-architecture/).

[See related discussion in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/EMBL-Design-Language/Sprint-2/issues/11).

## Building this on your machine

You'll need to build this on your local.

To install:
1. `bower install`
2. `yarn` or `npm install`

To develop:
1. `gulp`: Will build the Sass and serve to your browser with browserSync
2. Edit `index.html`, a file in `./scss` or `./js`
